      <section class="mystory">
        <p>I’m the child of an academic and a farmer/builder. Growing up I was expected to read good books, use good grammar, and work hard. And our old TV was rarely turned on. My children are convinced this means I was Amish. </p>
        <p>My mom taught me to write solid, clear sentences. My dad taught me how to throw a baseball, shoot a basketball, and tend a garden. Once, he got me up on a third-story roof to act as his safety-line, but I’ll save that story for another time. And, I taught myself how to draw, a practice that helped me learn to see and take notice.</p>
        <p>My inheritance of theory, thinking, and get-in-the-weeds-and-work, makes me the designer I am today. I probe to know the “why” behind a project. I’m curious about the philosophy that undergirds trends and decisions. I keep an eye on the content, helping clients shape their sentences, watching for inconsistencies, misspellings and incomplete sentences. I streamline repetitive work and harness the power of tools so I can complete projects efficiently while also managing time to explore and craft engaging visual solutions.</p>
        <p>Design is more than a job to me. Recently, I entered nursing school to explore whether a career change would satisfy my desire to help people. Although I learned many things during my 320+ hours in the hospital, I also came to the firm conclusion that design gets at the heart of who I am and good design does help people.</p>
        <p>  And while never Amish, I have lived close enough to their communities to appreciate their wariness of technology when it crowds out community or creativity. I want to be part of a team that uses design to build products that benefit humanity and that  seeks to tame wicked problems within healthcare, education, or government. </p>
